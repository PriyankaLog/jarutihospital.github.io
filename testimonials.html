When I knew about Jagruti, I came here with my husband and family members. We admitted him on 30th august 2010, after his admission, I frightened very much what will happen now. But Dr. Amar Shinde gave me confidence “do not worry”. We all are here for him. Doctor’s parents are also very cooperative. But after one month on 30th September 2010 we got his discharge. Dr. Shinde co operated with me very much and gave discharge to my husband.After that day my life has a great change. My husband is also changed totally. I saw unbelievable changes in him.</p>
            <p class="para">Now we are well settled. After 2-3 years, medicinal course is also over. But still we are in close contact with <b style="font-weight: 600;">Dr. Amar Shinde.</b></p>

                    Hi, my sister had mental health issues and I found Jagruti through lot of research and admitted her for long term treatment at Jagruti. This centre is a huge building fully equipped with latest medical care and services. This centre takes care of patients as if their own family members and treats them so kindly. There is dedicated staff who is always ready for utmost services and patient's family members get true relief until patient stays in center. I found good amount of difference after 6 months in my sister's health and I would like to really appreciate doctor and their family for making this happen. I'm really thankful for their love and care

                    Consulting Dr. Amar sir for treatment to my sister on schizophrenia. Before visiting Jagruti rehab, we consulted many other psychiatrist in Pune, but there were no results. After consulting at Jagruti, patient has improved a lot. It's very tough to come out of such diseases if patient does not have will power to come out. But, surely a supportive staff and doctors can raise the confidence of the patient and help him become more social again. Highly recommended to the people who are not getting cured since long time.

                <p class="para">My father is 82 yrs old & suffering from Alzheimer’s Dementia since last 8 yrs. Initially we could take care of him but, as it progressed it was very difficult to take care of him. He was violent intermittently & would pass urine & stool anywhere in the flat. We love father too much hence initially we did all the care but slowly everyone got frustrated, as we could not see his sufferings, we got helpless. Then we come to know about Jagruti Dementia Care Centre 3 yrs back. Initially we enquired but it was very difficult decision to admit him in a care facility. But finally 2 & 1/2 yrs back we admitted him for trial basis for 15 days but he got so much settled there that, we continued his admission till date. Intermittently he got critical but all the emergency treatment is taken care by the staff. We can visit him any time & every time he is fine. Since last 6 months he is unable to recognize anybody but his care is absolutely fine & we are happy to see him living there peacefully. We feel he is living in a temple. We strongly recommend this place for any Alzheimer’s dementia patient.</p>
